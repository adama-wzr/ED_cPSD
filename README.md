# ED_cPSD

This repository is dedicated to the simulation of continuous phase-size distributions based on the sequential Erosion-Dilation continuous Phase-Size Distribution (ED-cPSD) method. This novel approach combines the calculation of an Euclidean Distance Map (EDM) via the Meijster<sup>[1](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/S62.12/docs/Meijster_distance.pdf)</sup> algorithm for fast erosion-dilation operations at increasing radii. The individual phase-spaces obfuscated by the erosion step at each radii will then not return to the original size and shape via the dilation operation. These changes at each radii can be quantified, and then when normalized by the total number of phase-voxels removed at each step, give a continuous (in discrete space) probability density for phase-size, which is interpreted as being the phase-size distribution.
